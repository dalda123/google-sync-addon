<!--
    This file contains permissions to be granted by default.
    Default permissions are granted to special platform components and to apps
    that are approved to get default grants.
    The special components are apps that are expected to work out-of-the-box
    as they provide core use cases. These grants are managed by the platform.
    Fixed permissions cannot be controlled by the user and need a special
    approval. Typically these are to ensure either legally mandated functions
    or the app is considered a part of the OS.

    Granting these permissions could prevent issues on some ROMs or
    on non-clean installations.
